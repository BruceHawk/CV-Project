						<h2>Education</h2>
						<h4> George Dixon Academy (2014-2017)</h4>
						<p>I started secondary school back in 2014 at the age of 10. At that time I was attending George Dixon Academy from year 7 to year 9.
							 I went to George Dixon Academy as well as the Primary School since I use to live locally. 
							 </p>
							 <h4> Aston University Engineering Academy (AUEA) (2017-2019)</h4>
							 <p>After 3 years of attending George Dixon Academy I decided to apply for Aston University Engineering Academy (AUEA).
								 I was lucky enough to be one of the selected few that got a place there. I've gained skills constantly to improve myself and my future whilst attending AUEA. At AUEA I was able to acquire 8+ GCSE's</p>
							<h4>Holyhead Sixth Form (2019-2021)</h4>
							<p>As you can see I have changed schools many times. Nevertheless, Holyhead Sixth Form is where I realised being an adult isn't easy, which pushed me to strife to better myself. At this Sixth Form is where I gained 4 different levels.</p>
							<p>1 A-level (Mathematics) and 3 BTEC's in Law, Business and Applied Science.</p>

					<h2>Work Experience</h2>
					<h4>Nishkam Pharmacy (1 Week)</h4>
					<p>Nishkam Pharmacy was my first work experience which I did in year 10. Working at Nishkam Pharmacy enlighted me on life, how people work to support themselves, as well as the amount of people that go to the pharmacy to get help.
						Here is where I gained how to work under pressure, leadership skills, interpersonal skills, communication skills, work ethic skills, teamwork skills, problem-solving skills and adaptability skills.
					</p>
					<h4> Call Center (2021 May - 2021 August)</h4>
					<p>Working at a call center impacted my customer service by a large margin. I attained fantastic skills such as empathy, timeliness, dependability, patience, listening capacity and knowledge of services, which I then built upon further. </p>

						<h1>Project One</h1>
						<h2>Natural Environment Simulation</h2>
						<p>This was the most interesting and intrigueing project I've done so far. In this project I had to use Arrays to create multiple animals such as foxes, rabbits, etc. I used inheritance and interface because there was so much duplicates that if we didn't use inheritance or interface it would just take long to construct everything. In the process of completing this project I learnt how to do responsibility-driven design as it was a must to construct how everything will be done. I've realised using responsibility-driven design made it easier and faster to complete the project.</p>

						<h1>Project Two</h1>
						<h2>Ball Catcher</h2>
						<p>The Ball Catcher project was really hard at the beginning because I never had any coding experience before that. Doing this project taught me the use of classes and Objects and how they work from small matters such as a simple game like this one for example to greater things such as interpreting data.</p>

					<div class="project-info">
						<h1>Project Three</h1>
						<h2>Car Track</h2>
						<p>This project taught me the importance and useage of arrays. You can use arrays when there is a need to produce many variables of the same type. Arrays practically makes your life easier. This Car Track was my most entertaining project I've done becuase I would use this project to entertain my siblings so they would stop annoying me.</p>
